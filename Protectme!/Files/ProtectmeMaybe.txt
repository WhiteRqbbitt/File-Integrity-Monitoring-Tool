Placeholder text, often known as "lorem ipsum," is a type of filler content used in the design and publishing industry. It serves as a temporary stand-in for final content, helping designers and editors visualize and format their layout before the actual content is available. Derived from a work by Cicero—a Roman statesman, orator, and author—the classic "lorem ipsum" text has been used since the 16th century. Although it has no meaningful content in its standard form, it retains the structure and flow of natural language, making it invaluable for mock-ups and design drafts.
